**From hisaac:** I clain no ownership of this code. LED Spectrum Analyzer has been my go to iTunes visualizer for years. It seems that development has stagnated (Graham's last update was May 19th, 2014), but Graham kindly open sourced the plugin for us all to poke around at.

Someday, I'd like to update this, but for now it's just a public repository.
