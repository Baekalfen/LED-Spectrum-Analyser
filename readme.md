# LED Spectrum Analyzer for iTunes

[![Not Maintained](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintenance%20Level-Not%20Maintained-yellow.svg)](https://gist.github.com/cheerfulstoic/d107229326a01ff0f333a1d3476e068d)

This iTunes visualizer was originally developed by Graham Cox of Apptree software. Graham has let [his website](http://apptree.net)'s domain registration expire, and doesn't plan to continue updating or supporting this project. Thankfully, before the domain expired, he kindly open sourced the plugin's code.

I downloaded a copy of the code, and have uploaded it here for archival purposes. **This project is currently not maintained**, but if you want to hack on it, please feel free. If you would like to be the maintainer of this project, please get in touch with me.

Note: I am not a macOS developer, so I will not be able to help resolve issues. That said, please feel free to open issues for other people to help with.
