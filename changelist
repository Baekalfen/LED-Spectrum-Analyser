version 2.0.6 (September 06)

- added additional display size, now "small" is the original size, "large" is the new size (800 wide) and "fit to window" is as before.
- added "Stay visible" checkbox to track info; removed key shortcut for this.
- increased maximum font size for track info to 48 points.
- compiled for Intel Macs (Universal), includes a few minor code fixes to work on Intel.


version 2.0.5

- added additional animation palette
- linear and log mode full-scale values now calibrated more accurately, giving better FSD agreement in the two modes
- added "Choose random colours when track changes" setting
- added analogue VU meters layout option - meters fairly simple at this stage


version 2.0.4

- bug fix - better port management ensures that all drawing ends up where it should
- options dialog is now closed whenever the visualizer is turned off. This is better UI and also prevents some issues when
adjusting settings with the visualizer inactive
- added graduated colours to max option
- slightly less broken when using small and medium visualizer sizes (not recommended)
- streamed audio (e.g. radio stations) now correctly indicated in the track info


version 2.0.3

- track info now fades out rather than just blanking
- added 'j' keyboard command to turn on track info permanently
- added "unlit segments" feature, UI and pref key
- VU meters now default to 54 segments (though previous saved pref honoured)
- track info now uses current system encoding, so should now display non-Roman scripts correctly
- implemented exponential decay
- added UI to switch between linear and exp decay modes
- recalibrated decay/hold controls to give more useful range
- all timing/time constant computation now based on timestamp instead of counting frames- should give
more consistent results on widely differing systems
- added meter scales implementation and UI to enable/disable
- now disregards pref for segment count - this optimises performance and layout. Back to back now uses 48 segments.
- improved layout computations to give better results over a wider range of sizes.
- frequency scale more accurate (based on computed log tables rather than geometric tables)
- better choice of default colours, decay rates and other settings
- keyboard shortcuts now display feedback text in main window


version 2.0.2, March 19th 2004

- huge performance improvement by using direct pixel drawing (QDMP)
- bux fix in QDMP for 16-bit fill rect
- extended range of peak hold slider



version 2.0.1, March 19th 2004

- layout changes in prefs dialog to avoid numerous cosmetic issues on 10.2 Jaguar
- all slider controls now "live".
- added frequency bands slider to provide interface to existing setting
- added "Include album" checkbox to track info
- added Font size slider for track info
- changes to layout measurement to accommodate dynamic font size and frequency bands
- added geometric binning tables to permit user-adjustable frequency bands
- added keyboard controls for incrementing and decrementing bands (< and >)
- bug fixed where palette attached to buttons wasn't the one shown in the pop-up in some circumstances
- bug fixed where palette chosen for animated mode would revert to default when options closed and reopened
- NIB file changed to use custom controls instead of HIView objects for colour pop-ups. This allows the buttons to work on 10.2.
- track info now shows on initial startup of visualiser (if enabled)
- added menu separator between standard palettes and animation palettes in colour palette pop-up
(note this means that you might get the wrong palette first time you use this update - reselect the desired palette to correct this).
- track info can now be in any colour (no UI at present, but editable in plist)
- fix bug where peak colour was getting set to the same as the alt colour in animated mode
- change to plugin logic to ensure display can't "glitch" while iTunes paused and user opens dialog
- change so that trackinfo times out normally when iTunes is paused
